/**
 * The application object, which exists for exactly one reason: to put the
 * bedtime dim on every screen instead of most of them.
 *
 * The dim was opt-in per screen - `FocusUi.dimOverlay` added by hand in
 * `screenRoot`-based activities - so it reached the four tabs, the settings
 * screens and the block screen, and silently missed the safe browser, text
 * search, the video library and player, onboarding and the permission recovery
 * screen. Those are the ones you are most likely to actually be looking at
 * late at night, which made "bedtime dims the screen" read as broken.
 *
 * Attaching it from a lifecycle callback instead means it covers every
 * activity, including any added later, without each one having to remember.
