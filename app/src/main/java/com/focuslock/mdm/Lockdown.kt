/**
 * The hardest state the app has: FocusLock closed against itself.
 *
 * An overlay schedule window already pins the phone so nothing but FocusLock
 * and the named apps can come forward. But FocusLock is still FocusLock -
 * Library still opens the browser, Rules still scrolls, Tasks is still there -
 * so the "dead phone" it promises is really "a phone that is only this app",
 * which is not the same thing and is still very much a place to spend an hour.
 *
 * Lockdown closes that. While it holds, the shell shows one screen: what is
 * holding it, when it lifts, and the essentials. No tabs, no library, no rules.
 *
 * ## Why this cannot loop
 *
 * The obvious way to build this - have the enforcement loop overlay FocusLock
 * the way it overlays other apps - is exactly the fatal loop the request warned
 * about: the overlay covers FocusLock, FocusLock is what the overlay tells you
 * to go to, and the two fight forever. So nothing here overlays anything.
 * [AppBlockerService] still returns early the moment our own package is in
 * front, unchanged. This is FocusLock's own shell choosing to draw a different
 * screen, which is an ordinary UI decision with nothing to fight.
 *
 * ## Why it cannot trap anyone
 *
 * It ends on its own clock, it never outranks a permission emergency (that
 * screen has to stay reachable or a revoked permission would be unrecoverable),
 * the always-allowed apps stay launchable from it so a phone call is always
 * possible, and a factory reset is still a factory reset.
